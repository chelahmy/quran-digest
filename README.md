# The Quran Digest
A utility to digest or hash the Quran digital text based on the [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) algorithm popularly used to hash transactions in the Bitcoin blockchain. It produces a 256-bit hash which is also known as a Merkle root. As long as the Quran text has not been altered the hash will remain the same. Even altering a single letter in the text will strikingly change the hash. It is a good practice to digest the Quran every time it is refered to, and compare the hash with the original one. The following is the current digest/hash of the Quran digital text:

We intent to inscribe the hash into the Bitcoin blockchain so that it will be an everlasting reference. The hash above may get hacked but the one inscribed in the Bitcoin blockchain will be well-preserved.
