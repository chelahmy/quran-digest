# The Quran Digest
A utility to digest or hash the Quran text based on the [Merkle tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree) algorithm used in the Bitcoin blockchain. It produces a 256-bit hash which is also known as a Merkle root. As long as the Quran text has not been altered the hash will remain the same. Even a single letter alteration will strikingly change the hash. The objective is to saveguard the Quran from being altered and to make it the single source of reference for the entire world. The following is the current digest/hash of the Quran text:

We intent to inscribe the hash into the Bitcoin blockchain so that it will be everlasting reference. The hash above may be hacked but not the one in the Bitcoin blockchain.
